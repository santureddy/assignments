Where `name: jenkins` refers to the serviceAccount created for jenkins.
We can also define which plugins we want to install on our Jenkins. We use some default plugins like git and the pipeline plugin.

Now you can install Jenkins by running the helm install command and passing it the following arguments:

The name of the release jenkins

The -f flag with the YAML file with overrides jenkins-values.yaml

The name of the chart jenkinsci/jenkins

The -n flag with the name of your namespace jenkins

$ chart=jenkinsci/jenkins
$ helm install jenkins -n jenkins -f jenkins-values.yaml $chart
